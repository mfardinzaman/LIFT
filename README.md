# Workout Routine Tracker

## A way to keep track of your workout routine and current progress

### About:
This application is intended for beginners and experts alike who go to the gym for weightlifting. Its aim is for the
user to be able to create workout routines with a number of selected exercises with their associated sets and reps. The
user will also be able to create exercise names to add to their workout routines. During the actual workout, the user
will be able to input how many sets they've completed so far, how many reps they were able to complete in each set, and
the amount of weight they were able to lift (this could be either barbell, dumbbell, kettleball, etc. which is
associated with the exercise). After completion of each exercise, the application will indicate if the goal from the
workout routine has been met.

I hope this project will help motivate me into getting into the gym. It bridges my interest in fitness with my interest
in programming.
